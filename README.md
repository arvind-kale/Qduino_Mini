# **What is the Qduino Mini?**

It's an open source Arduino - Compatible development board just like the Leonardo, but with many added features - it's small (1" x 1.5"), light, has a LiPo battery connector, a built - in LiPo fuel gauge to check when you need to charge the battery, and a built - in LiPo Charger circuit so you can keep your project as is, and just plug in USB to charge.  Better yet, it's only $25!

It's designed + engineered by Qtechknow & engineered + manufactured by SparkFun, all under the open source hardware framework!
